i found a two-minute hack that can drastically increase your audience. i spent over 60 hours scripting a video recently. i was super proud of it but when i came back i saw to it a day after it had gone live. i had this happen to the algorithm. i worked really hard on a me recently. I was preparing and researching and i was preparing  for a video for over a month. I spent a ton of time and effort and energy into my video. After it had gone live i saw one of those dreaded obstacles. i saw a dip at a very specific very specific dip. I then went into the youtube video editor and chopped that segment completely out of my video. That was that from then on since that friction point had been eliminated. The only thing that was killing it was the fact thing was killing the fact that i said in 2019. If you want to do this for your videos all you have to do is go to videos. Go to youtube studio hover over the video that you think might have some friction. Click on analytics in your points and click on analytics on your analytics. You'll be able to see your analytics you'll be. Once you identify them all you have to once you identify the friction points in a video you'll be able to see your analytics and pick out any audience retention. Once you identify these friction points you can then apply those changes to the video. In a few hours youtube will have removed any of those bits indicated in removed. Your video itself will still remain the same. You'll still have the same views same comments still have same views.
