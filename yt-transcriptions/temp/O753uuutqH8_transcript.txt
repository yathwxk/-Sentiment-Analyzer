hi I'm kianne and welcome to crash hi I'm kianne and welcome to crash course computer science so we've talked course computer science so we've talked course computer science so we've talked a lot about sorting in this series and a lot about sorting in this series and a lot about sorting in this series and often code to sort a list of numbers is often code to sort a list of numbers is often code to sort a list of numbers is only 10 lines long which is pretty easy only 10 lines long which is pretty easy only 10 lines long which is pretty easy for a single programmer to write plus for a single programmer to write plus for a single programmer to write plus it's short enough that you don't need it's short enough that you don't need it's short enough that you don't need any special tools you can do it in any special tools you can do it in any special tools you can do it in notepad really but a sorting algorithm notepad really but a sorting algorithm notepad really but a sorting algorithm isn't a program it's likely only a small isn't a program it's likely only a small isn't a program it's likely only a small part of a much larger program for part of a much larger program for part of a much larger program for example Microsoft Office has roughly 40 example Microsoft Office has roughly 40 example Microsoft Office has roughly 40 million lines of code 40 million that's million lines of code 40 million that's million lines of code 40 million that's way too big for any one person to figure way too big for any one person to figure way too big for any one person to figure out and write to build huge programs out and write to build huge programs out and write to build huge programs like this programmers use a set of tools like this programmers use a set of tools like this programmers use a set of tools and practices taken together these form and practices taken together these form and practices taken together these form the discipline of software engineering a the discipline of software engineering a the discipline of software engineering a term coined by engineer Margaret term coined by engineer Margaret term coined by engineer Margaret Hamilton who helped NASA prevent serious Hamilton who helped NASA prevent serious Hamilton who helped NASA prevent serious problems on the Apollo 11 Mission To The problems on the Apollo 11 Mission To The problems on the Apollo 11 Mission To The Moon she want explained it this way it's Moon she want explained it this way it's Moon she want explained it this way it's kind of like a root canal you waited kind of like a root canal you waited kind of like a root canal you waited till the end but there are things you till the end but there are things you till the end but there are things you could have done beforehand it's like could have done beforehand it's like could have done beforehand it's like preventative healthare but it's preventative healthare but it's preventative healthare but it's preventative software as I mentioned in episode 12 breaking as I mentioned in episode 12 breaking big programs into smaller functions big programs into smaller functions big programs into smaller functions allows many people to work allows many people to work allows many people to work simultaneously they don't have to worry simultaneously they don't have to worry simultaneously they don't have to worry about the whole thing just the function about the whole thing just the function about the whole thing just the function they're working on so if you're task they're working on so if you're task they're working on so if you're task with writing a sort algorithm you only with writing a sort algorithm you only with writing a sort algorithm you only need to make sure it sorts properly and need to make sure it sorts properly and need to make sure it sorts properly and efficiently however even packing up code efficiently however even packing up code efficiently however even packing up code into functions isn't enough Microsoft into functions isn't enough Microsoft into functions isn't enough Microsoft Office probably contains hundreds of Office probably contains hundreds of Office probably contains hundreds of thousands of them that's better than thousands of them that's better than thousands of them that's better than dealing with 40 million lines of code dealing with 40 million lines of code dealing with 40 million lines of code but it's still way too many things for but it's still way too many things for but it's still way too many things for one person not te to manage the solution one person not te to manage the solution one person not te to manage the solution is to package functions into hierarchies is to package functions into hierarchies is to package functions into hierarchies pulling related code together into pulling related code together into pulling related code together into objects for example cars software might objects for example cars software might objects for example cars software might have several functions related to cruise have several functions related to cruise have several functions related to cruise control like setting speed nudging speed control like setting speed nudging speed control like setting speed nudging speed up or down and stopping cruise control up or down and stopping cruise control up or down and stopping cruise control altogether since they're all related we altogether since they're all related we altogether since they're all related we can wrap them up into a unified cruise can wrap them up into a unified cruise can wrap them up into a unified cruise control object but we don't have to stop control object but we don't have to stop control object but we don't have to stop there cruise control is just one part of there cruise control is just one part of there cruise control is just one part of the engine software there might also be the engine software there might also be the engine software there might also be sets of functions that control spark sets of functions that control spark sets of functions that control spark plug ignition fuel pumps and the plug ignition fuel pumps and the plug ignition fuel pumps and the radiator so we can create a parent radiator so we can create a parent radiator so we can create a parent engine object object that contains all engine object object that contains all engine object object that contains all of these children objects in addition to of these children objects in addition to of these children objects in addition to Children objects the engine itself might Children objects the engine itself might Children objects the engine itself might have its own functions you want to be have its own functions you want to be have its own functions you want to be able to stop and start it for example able to stop and start it for example able to stop and start it for example it'll also have its own variables like it'll also have its own variables like it'll also have its own variables like how many miles the car has traveled in how many miles the car has traveled in how many miles the car has traveled in general objects can contain other general objects can contain other general objects can contain other objects functions and variables and of objects functions and variables and of objects functions and variables and of course the engine is just one part of a course the engine is just one part of a course the engine is just one part of a car object there's also the transmission car object there's also the transmission car object there's also the transmission Wheels doors windows and so on now as a Wheels doors windows and so on now as a Wheels doors windows and so on now as a programmer if I want to set the cruise programmer if I want to set the cruise programmer if I want to set the cruise control I navigate down the object control I navigate down the object control I navigate down the object hierarchy from the outermost objects to hierarchy from the outermost objects to hierarchy from the outermost objects to more and more deeply nested ones if more and more deeply nested ones if more and more deeply nested ones if eventually I reach the function I want eventually I reach the function I want eventually I reach the function I want to trigger car then engine then cruise to trigger car then engine then cruise to trigger car then engine then cruise control then set cruise speed to 55 control then set cruise speed to 55 control then set cruise speed to 55 programming languages often use programming languages often use programming languages often use something equivalent to the syntax shown something equivalent to the syntax shown something equivalent to the syntax shown here the idea of packing up functional here the idea of packing up functional here the idea of packing up functional units into nested objects is called units into nested objects is called units into nested objects is called objectoriented programming this is very objectoriented programming this is very objectoriented programming this is very similar to what we've done all series similar to what we've done all series similar to what we've done all series long HED complexity by encapsulating long HED complexity by encapsulating long HED complexity by encapsulating low-level details in higher order low-level details in higher order low-level details in higher order components before we packed up things components before we packed up things components before we packed up things like transistor circuits into higher like transistor circuits into higher like transistor circuits into higher level Boolean Gates now we're doing the level Boolean Gates now we're doing the level Boolean Gates now we're doing the same thing with software yet again it's same thing with software yet again it's same thing with software yet again it's a way to move move up a new level of abstraction breaking up a big program abstraction breaking up a big program like a car's software into functional like a car's software into functional like a car's software into functional units is perfect for teams one team units is perfect for teams one team units is perfect for teams one team might be responsible for the cruise might be responsible for the cruise might be responsible for the cruise control system and a single programmer control system and a single programmer control system and a single programmer on that team tackles a handful of on that team tackles a handful of on that team tackles a handful of functions this is similar to how big functions this is similar to how big functions this is similar to how big physical things are built like physical things are built like physical things are built

control example its code is going to control example its code is going to control example its code is going to have to make use of functions in other have to make use of functions in other have to make use of functions in other parts of the engine software to you know parts of the engine software to you know parts of the engine software to you know keep the car at a constant speed that keep the car at a constant speed that keep the car at a constant speed that code isn't part of the cruise control code isn't part of the cruise control code isn't part of the cruise control team's responsibility it's another team's responsibility it's another team's responsibility it's another team's code because the cruise control team's code because the cruise control team's code because the cruise control team didn't write that they're going to team didn't write that they're going to team didn't write that they're going to need good documentation about what each need good documentation about what each need good documentation about what each function in the code does and a function in the code does and a function in the code does and a well-defined application programming well-defined application programming well-defined application programming interface or API for short you can think interface or API for short you can think interface or API for short you can think of an API as the way that collaborating of an API as the way that collaborating of an API as the way that collaborating programmers interact across various programmers interact across various programmers interact across various parts of the code for example in the parts of the code for example in the parts of the code for example in the ignition control object there might be ignition control object there might be ignition control object there might be functions to set the RPM of the engine functions to set the RPM of the engine functions to set the RPM of the engine check the spark plug voltage as well as check the spark plug voltage as well as check the spark plug voltage as well as fire the individual spark plugs being fire the individual spark plugs being fire the individual spark plugs being able to set the motor's RPM is really able to set the motor's RPM is really able to set the motor's RPM is really useful the cruise control team is going useful the cruise control team is going useful the cruise control team is going to need to call that function but they to need to call that function but they to need to call that function but they don't know much about how the ignition don't know much about how the ignition don't know much about how the ignition system works it's not a good idea to let system works it's not a good idea to let system works it's not a good idea to let them call functions that fire the them call functions that fire the them call functions that fire the individual spark plugs or the engine individual spark plugs or the engine individual spark plugs or the engine might explode maybe the API allows the might explode maybe the API allows the might explode maybe the API allows the right people access to the right right people access to the right right people access to the right functions and data objectoriented functions and data objectoriented functions and data objectoriented programming languages do this by letting programming languages do this by letting programming languages do this by letting you specify whether functions are public you specify whether functions are public you specify whether functions are public or private if a function is marked as or private if a function is marked as or private if a function is marked as private it means only functions inside private it means only functions inside private it means only functions inside that object can call it so in this that object can call it so in this that object can call it so in this example only other functions inside of example only other functions inside of example only other functions inside of ignition control like the set RPM ignition control like the set RPM ignition control like the set RPM function can fire the spark plugs on the function can fire the spark plugs on the function can fire the spark plugs on the other hand because the set RPM function other hand because the set RPM function other hand because the set RPM function is marked as public other objects can is marked as public other objects can is marked as public other objects can call it like cruise control this ability call it like cruise control this ability call it like cruise control this ability to hide complexity and selectively to hide complexity and selectively to hide complexity and selectively reveal it is the essence of reveal it is the essence of reveal it is the essence of object-oriented programming and it's a object-oriented programming and it's a object-oriented programming and it's a powerful and popular way to tackle powerful and popular way to
