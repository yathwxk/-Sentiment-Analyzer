[Music] [Music] i found a two-minute hack that can i found a two-minute hack that can i found a two-minute hack that can drastically increase your audience drastically increase your audience drastically increase your audience retention of videos that you've already retention of videos that you've already retention of videos that you've already posted to your channel look youtube can posted to your channel look youtube can posted to your channel look youtube can be incredibly frustrating you put a ton be incredibly frustrating you put a ton be incredibly frustrating you put a ton of time and effort and energy into your of time and effort and energy into your of time and effort and energy into your videos you post them to youtube you go videos you post them to youtube you go videos you post them to youtube you go to bed and then you wake up the next to bed and then you wake up the next to bed and then you wake up the next morning and they have a grand total of morning and they have a grand total of morning and they have a grand total of four views again and often the worst four views again and often the worst four views again and often the worst part is when you log into your analytics part is when you log into your analytics part is when you log into your analytics dashboard and you look at your audience dashboard and you look at your audience dashboard and you look at your audience retention graphs they look like a retention graphs they look like a retention graphs they look like a downward staircase and you think downward staircase and you think downward staircase and you think yourself how could this happen i thought yourself how could this happen i thought yourself how could this happen i thought this video was so good this video was so good this video was so good well here's the thing sometimes that well here's the thing sometimes that well here's the thing sometimes that video actually was really good however video actually was really good however video actually was really good however there might be specific points within there might be specific points within there might be specific points within the video that triggered people and the video that triggered people and the video that triggered people and caused them to leave and resulted in caused them to leave and resulted in caused them to leave and resulted in them not consuming the remainder of the them not consuming the remainder of the them not consuming the remainder of the video in other words it doesn't matter video in other words it doesn't matter video in other words it doesn't matter how great your video was overall these how great your video was overall these how great your video was overall these little obstacles these drop-offs these little obstacles these drop-offs these little obstacles these drop-offs these dips especially if they're early on ruin dips especially if they're early on ruin dips especially if they're early on ruin your chances of getting a high average your chances of getting a high average your chances of getting a high average view duration and getting promoted by view duration and getting promoted by view duration and getting promoted by the algorithm and i had this happen to the algorithm and i had this happen to the algorithm and i had this happen to me recently i worked really hard on a me recently i worked really hard on a me recently i worked really hard on a video i spent over 60 hours scripting video i spent over 60 hours scripting video i spent over 60 hours scripting preparing and researching and i was preparing and researching and i was preparing and researching and i was super proud of it but when i came back super proud of it but when i came back super proud of it but when i came back to it a day after it had gone live i saw to it a day after it had gone live i saw to it a day after it had gone live i saw one of those dreaded obstacles i saw a one of those dreaded obstacles i saw a one of those dreaded obstacles i saw a very specific dip at a very specific very specific dip at a very specific very specific dip at a very specific point and when i re-watched the video i point and when i re-watched the video i point and when i re-watched the video i realized i had phrased something super realized i had phrased something super realized i had phrased something super stupidly which caused a bunch of people stupidly which caused a bunch of people stupidly which caused a bunch of people to leave and was ruining my retention to leave and was ruining my retention to leave and was ruining my retention outside of that one point the rest of outside of that one point the rest of outside of that one point the rest of video was great and was retaining tons video was great and was retaining tons video was great and was retaining tons of people but the problem was early on a of people but the problem was early on a of people but the problem was early on a bunch of viewers were hitting that wall bunch of viewers were hitting that wall bunch of viewers were hitting that wall that obstacle and dropping off before that obstacle and dropping off before that obstacle and dropping off before they could get to the good bit and so they could get to the good bit and so they could get to the good bit and so here's the thing i did that took me here's the thing i did that took me here's the thing i did that took me literally less than two minutes but may literally less than two minutes but may literally less than two minutes but may have saved that video i simply went into have saved that video i simply went into have saved that video i simply went into the youtube video editor and chopped the youtube video editor and chopped the youtube video editor and chopped that segment completely out of my video that segment completely out of my video that segment completely out of my video and that was that from then on since and that was that from then on since and that was that from then on since that friction point had been eliminated that friction point had been eliminated that friction point had been eliminated it was easier for more people to flow on it was easier for more people to flow on it was easier for more people to flow on and continue watching the rest of my and continue watching the rest of my and continue watching the rest of my video now i'm not saying all those video now i'm not saying all those video now i'm not saying all those people would have continued watching the people would have continued watching the people would have continued watching the entire video but the very least most of entire video but the very least most of entire video but the very least most of them left the video later than they them left the video later than they them left the video later than they would have if i hadn't removed that would have if i hadn't removed that would have if i hadn't removed that friction point and that meant that friction point and that meant that friction point and that meant that overall i get a higher average view overall i get a higher average view overall i get a higher average view duration so this is a super easy but duration so this is a super easy but duration so this is a super easy but ninja technique you can use and i'll ninja technique you can use and i'll ninja technique you can use and i'll show you how to do it in just a sec but show you how to do it in just a sec but show you how to do it in just a sec but i want to give you one more example i want to give you one more example i want to give you one more example because another cool way you can use because another cool way you can use because another cool way you can use this is with dates no not romantic dates this is with dates no not romantic dates this is with dates no not romantic dates i'm still figuring that one out but like i'm still figuring that one out but like i'm still figuring that one out but like date and times for example i had a video date and times for example i had a video date and times for example i had a video about the best editing software for about the best editing software for about the best editing software for gaming youtubers at the beginning of gaming youtubers at the beginning of gaming youtubers at the beginning of that video i said so in 2019 what are that video i said so in 2019 what are that video i said so in 2019 what are the best editing softwares for gaming the best editing softwares for gaming the best editing softwares for gaming youtubers or something like that i can't youtubers or something like that i can't youtubers or something like that i can't remember exactly what i said now that remember exactly what i said now that remember exactly what i said now that worked great for 2019 but nowadays the worked great for 2019 but nowadays the worked great for 2019 but nowadays the 2019 bit of that hook is more likely to 2019 bit of that hook is more likely to 2019 bit of that hook is more likely to be a negative rather than a positive the be a negative rather than a positive the be a negative rather than a positive the annoying thing was though that all of annoying thing was though that all of annoying thing was though that all of the information in that video was still the information in that video was still the information in that video was still very relevant and up to date the only very relevant and up to date the only very relevant and up to date the only thing that was killing it was the fact thing that was killing it was the fact thing that was killing it was the fact that i said in 2019 so what i did again that i said in 2019 so what i did again that i said in 2019 so what i did again went into the youtube video editor went into the youtube video editor went into the youtube video editor chopped off the so in 2019 bit and so chopped off the so in 2019 bit and so chopped off the so in 2019 bit and so after that the video simply started with after that the video simply started with after that the video simply started with what are the best video editing what are the best video editing what are the best video editing softwares to edit gaming videos for softwares to edit gaming videos for softwares to edit gaming videos for youtube and that would have resulted in youtube and that would have resulted in youtube and that would have resulted in more people sticking with my video early more people sticking with my video early more people sticking with my video early on so if you want to do this for your on so if you want to do this for your on so if you want to do this for your videos all you have to do is go to videos all you have to do is go to videos all you have to do is go to youtube studio hover over the video that youtube studio hover over the video that youtube studio hover over the video that you think might have some friction you think might have some friction you think might have some friction points and click on analytics in your points and click on analytics in your points and click on analytics in your analytics you'll be able to see your analytics you'll be able to see your analytics you'll be able to see your audience retention and pick out any audience retention and pick out any audience retention and pick out any potential friction points i'll talk more potential friction points i'll talk more potential friction points i'll talk more about how to do that in a second but about how to do that in a second but about how to do that in a second but once you identify them all you have to once you identify them all you have to once you identify them all you have to do is come over to this editor tab and do is come over to this editor tab and do is come over to this editor tab and then you click here to bring up this then you click here to bring up this then you click here to bring up this screen then all you have to do is drag screen then all you have to do is drag screen then all you have to do is drag these little playheads so the part of these little playheads so the part of these little playheads so the part of the video you want to remove is darkened the video you want to remove is darkened the video you want to remove is darkened out then you just apply those changes out then you just apply those changes out then you just apply those changes and in a few hours youtube will have and in a few hours youtube will have and in a few hours youtube will have removed any of those bits indicated in removed any of those bits indicated in removed any of those bits indicated in the grayed out area but your video the grayed out area but your video the grayed out area but your video itself will still remain the same you'll itself will still remain the same you'll itself will still remain the same you'll still have the same views same comments still have the same views same comments still have the same views same comments same everything all that's changed is same everything all that's changed is same everything all that's changed is you've removed the little friction point you've removed the little friction point you've removed the little friction point and there you go you've given your video and there you go you've given your video and there you go you've given your video a much better data driven chance of a much better data driven chance of a much better data driven chance of succeeding and it's literally taking you succeeding and it's literally taking you succeeding and it's literally taking you all of two minutes but if you need help all of two minutes but if you need help all of two minutes but if you need help learning how to actually analyze your learning how to actually analyze your learning how to actually analyze your audience retention graphs what to look audience retention graphs what to look audience retention graphs what to look for click on the video up on screen now for click on the video up on screen now for click on the video up on screen now you know i'm going to go over a bunch of you know i'm going to go over a bunch of you know i'm going to go over a bunch of different examples specifically focusing different examples specifically focusing different examples specifically focusing on intros and outros because they can be on intros and outros because they can be on intros and outros because they can be super important so click it now and i'll super important so click it now and i'll super important so click it now and i'll see you there
